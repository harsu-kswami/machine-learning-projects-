 E-Commerce Sales Forecasting: Project Roadmap This project follows a structured machine learning workflow to forecast daily sales based on historical transaction data. The process is divided into three main phases: data preparation, feature engineering, and model optimization.

Phase 1: Data Preparation and Exploration The goal of this phase is to clean the raw data and transform it into a usable time-series format.

1.1. Load Data: Import the Online Retail.xlsx dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

1.2. Initial EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Perform an initial analysis (.info(), .describe()) to understand the data's structure, identify missing values, and spot anomalies like negative quantities.

1.3. Data Cleaning: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing CustomerIDs and removing returns (transactions with negative Quantity).

1.4. Time-Series Aggregation: Create a Sales column (Quantity * UnitPrice) and aggregate the transactional data into a daily_sales time series.

Phase 2: Advanced Feature Engineering The goal of this phase is to create intelligent features that provide the model with deep context about temporal patterns and events.

2.1. Create Baseline Features: Generate standard time-based features (dayofweek, month, year), lag features (lag_7), and rolling window statistics (rolling_mean_7).

2.2. Engineer Holiday Features:

Identify all 2011 UK public holidays using the holidays library.

Create a binary flag column (is_holiday) to mark these specific days.

Create "proximity" features (days_until_christmas, days_after_christmas) to model the buildup and cooldown around the most critical sales period.

2.3. Engineer Cyclical Features: Transform month and dayofweek using Sine/Cosine functions to help the model understand their cyclical nature (e.g., that December is next to January).

Phase 3: Model Training and Optimization The goal of this phase is to train, tune, and evaluate a powerful machine learning model to get the most accurate forecast possible.

3.1. Final Data Preparation: Combine all engineered features into a final feature set, drop any rows with NaN values, and perform a chronological train-test split.

3.2. Model Selection: Train and evaluate baseline versions of powerful tree-based models (XGBoost and LightGBM) to select the best-performing algorithm for this dataset.

3.3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV to systematically search for the optimal settings (hyperparameters) for the champion model.

3.4. Final Evaluation: Train one final model using the best-found parameters and evaluate its performance on the unseen test set to determine the final R-squared (RÂ²) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
